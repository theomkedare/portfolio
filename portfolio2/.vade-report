## Vercel Web Analytics Configuration

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for the Next.js portfolio project.

### Changes Made

**1. Installed @vercel/analytics package**
   - Added `@vercel/analytics` version ^1.6.1 to package.json dependencies
   - Updated package-lock.json with new dependency tree

**2. Configured Analytics component in App Router**
   - Modified `src/app/layout.js` to add the `<Analytics />` component
   - Placed the component inside the `<body>` tag, after the `<main>` content area
   - The import statement was already present but the component wasn't being used

### Files Modified

- `package.json` - Added @vercel/analytics dependency
- `package-lock.json` - Updated with new package dependencies  
- `src/app/layout.js` - Added `<Analytics />` component to the root layout

### Implementation Details

This is an App Router Next.js project (using the `app/` directory structure), so the Analytics component was added to the root layout file at `src/app/layout.js`. The component is positioned at the end of the body tag to ensure it doesn't interfere with the main content rendering.

The Analytics component will now track page views and user interactions across all pages in the portfolio, providing insights through Vercel's analytics dashboard.

### Verification

✅ Build completed successfully (`npm run build`)
✅ Linter passed with no errors (`npm run lint`)
✅ No test script configured (none to run)
✅ All production pages render correctly (8 routes generated)

The implementation follows Next.js best practices and Vercel's official documentation for integrating Web Analytics in App Router projects.
